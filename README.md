# Odd-or-Even-Card-Game
About the Project:- 
1] I have created an Odd or Even Card Game (Human vs Human) Mobile Application for Android OS.

2] User Requirements:

*The system must support two users on the same device.
*It should display the drawn cards visually.
*The user must be able to input their guesses (odd/even).
*The system must calculate and show results dynamically.
*Final results and scores should be clearly displayed.

3] Key Features-
i} Automated Deck Management:
Represents a standard 52-card deck digitally.
Automated shuffling and drawing of cards for each player.
ii} Sum Calculation and Parity Check:
Computes the sum of the drawn cards.
Determines if the sum is odd or even.
iii} Result Declaration:
Compares player guesses with the calculated sum's parity.
Clearly declares the winner(s) or a tie.
iv} User-Friendly Interface:
An intuitive graphical interface displaying cards, guesses, results, and scores.
Clear buttons for actions like "Play Game" and "Exit."
